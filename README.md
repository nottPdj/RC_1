This project was realized for the Curricular Unit of Computer Networks which aims
for the implementation of a communication protocol for the transmission of files through
a RS-232 Serial Port cable.
Throughout the development of this project, we applied and reinforced the
contents covered in the theoretical classes including protocol design, error detection and
correction, data link layer mechanisms, and reliable data transfer techniques.
